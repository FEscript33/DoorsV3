## Hello tresspasser
My name is Smart. Creator of thia repository, and if you are viewing this, well, why are you reading this anyway? It's kind of pointless, trying to steal unfinished scripts. It's embarrasing! If you are viewing this, but you aren't looking to steal code **GOOD FOR YOU** as for the the code stealers..
Really the only thing on this repository, (or not) are here: https://github.com/Smartlightyear/DoorsV3/blob/main/LearnRBXCode.md, https://github.com/Smartlightyear/DoorsV3/blob/main/OrionLibFix.md, and https://github.com/Smartlightyear/DoorsV3/blob/main/CodeBoxDoc.md. Thank you for reading.
